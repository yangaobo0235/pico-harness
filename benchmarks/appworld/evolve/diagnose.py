"""AppWorld failure diagnosis into a WHY/WHERE taxonomy (in-package).

Two taxonomy sources, toggled by the caller (default = hardcoded):

- **hardcoded** (default): the hand-derived 7 AppWorld WHY classes (W1-W7), derived once by
  hand from real vanilla trajectories. Frozen constant :data:`DEFAULT_APPWORLD_TAXONOMY`.
- **induce**: the bench-neutral open-ended map-reduce in
  :mod:`pico.evolver.orchestrator.nodes.taxonomy` discovers a taxonomy from
  vanilla failures; :func:`ensure_taxonomy` here is the AppWorld-bound wrapper
  (AppWorld bench description, W1-W7 as the hardcoded default). Induction
  failure raises — it never silently substitutes the hardcoded table.

Diagnosis is **multi-label**: one trajectory can exhibit several failure modes,
so it may land in several ``WHERE::WHY`` cells (each hit increments that WHY's
count). Output is a failure_map dict shaped exactly like
``failure_map_builder.build_failure_map`` so the orchestrator's
``select_target_whys`` / design step are unchanged:

    {"why_distribution": {why: count},
     "cells": {"<WHERE>::<WHY>": {"candidates": [
         {"trajectory_id", "reasoning", "components": [{"summary": fix_hint}]}]}},
     "_n_judged": n}
