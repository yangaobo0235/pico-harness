"""The single agent tool for AppWorld: execute Python in the AppWorld REPL.

AppWorld is pinned to pydantic v1 (via sqlmodel) while Pico needs pydantic
v2, so the two cannot share a venv. We therefore run AppWorld as its own HTTP
``environment`` server (``appworld serve environment``, in the AppWorld venv) and
talk to it over HTTP from here — this module never imports ``appworld``.

This tool routes the agent's code to ``POST {env_url}/execute`` (the stateful
in-server world REPL): variables, imports and logins persist across calls. One
env server holds ONE world at a time, so the batch runner gives each concurrent
task its own server/port.

This file is deliberately plain vanilla: it adds nothing to the model's inputs
or outputs beyond the REPL round-trip. It sits inside the evolution whitelist,
so improvements to it are the evolver's job — shipping pre-built assists here
would let a candidate "win" by switching them on.
