"""Text normalisation helpers - the evolvable surface of this subject repo.

This module lives at ``benchmarks/appworld/agent_cli.py`` because that path is a
hard contract, not a naming preference. ``pico.evolver.candidate_manifest``
ships exactly one supported Candidate Label, ``runtime``, and its
``LabelPolicy.mutable_paths`` allowlist is
``("benchmarks/appworld/agent_cli.py", "benchmarks/appworld/tool.py")``. G5 runs
before a candidate commit exists and rejects any target outside that allowlist,
so a subject module at any other path would make every candidate fail G5 with no
commit to inspect.

The code that grades this module lives under ``benchmarks/appworld/evolve/``,
which the evolver immutable kernel forbids any candidate from touching.

Everything below is deterministic and stdlib-only: the same input always yields
the same output, so a K-trial evaluation measures the code, not the weather.
