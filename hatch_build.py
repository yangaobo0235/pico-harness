"""Custom Hatchling build hook: conditionally package the prebuilt TUI bundle.

The TUI ships as a single self-contained esbuild bundle at ``ui-tui/dist/entry.js``.
We want a wheel to carry it so `uv tool install` yields a working
`pico` with no source checkout. But ``dist/`` is a build artifact and is
NOT committed (see .gitignore), so a clean checkout legitimately lacks it.

A static ``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` entry would make
hatchling hard-fail with "Forced include not found" whenever ``dist/`` is
absent — which would break the ordinary developer flow (`git clone && uv sync`
with no prior `npm run build`). So instead we add the bundle to the wheel's
force-include map *only when it exists*, and emit a warning otherwise.

Release builds run ``npm ci --prefix ui-tui`` and ``make build-tui`` first, so
the published wheel carries the bundle. Developer builds without it fall back
to the source tree at runtime (see ``resolve_dist_entry()`` in
``pico/cli/tui_commands.py``).
