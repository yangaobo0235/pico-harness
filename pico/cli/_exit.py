"""Hard-exit past CPython interpreter finalization for native-unsafe runtimes.

Building the agent loop opens a lancedb-backed store, and lancedb starts a
process-global ``LanceDBBackgroundEventLoop`` (Rust/tokio) daemon thread with
no public shutdown hook. Finalizing the interpreter while that native runtime
is still live segfaults (``Py_FinalizeEx``; SIGSEGV, exit 139), masking the
command's real exit code. Every Pico command that builds the loop starts that
thread, so the guard lives once at the CLI exit chokepoint
(:func:`pico.cli.commands.run`): when the hazard is live, flush and
``os._exit`` past finalization.

CliRunner invokes the Typer ``app`` object directly (in-process), never the
console-script ``run`` wrapper, so test hosts keep normal exit semantics.
