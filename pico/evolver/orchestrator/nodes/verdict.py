"""执行 Step ⑦：为 findings log 起草 per-round semantic verdict。

After the gates decide bank/prune, the driver drafts a short narrative for the
findings log: what this round tried, what the result was, the next target, and
whether the curve looks like a capability ceiling. This is advisory — the loop's
stop decision is the deterministic :class:`TerminationTracker`, never this
verdict — but the ``ceiling_signal`` hint is what a human reads to decide an
early unseal (SOP §154 low-ceiling note).

Kept schema-light (three fields) so even a weak driver returns something usable;
parse failure non-fatal，caller 回退 plain summary。verdict advisory，不控制 stop/promotion。
