"""Bench-neutral scoring contract — the one currency the funnel scores in.

Every consumer in the seven-step funnel (screen, paired gate, sealed ledger)
reads only :attr:`TaskEval.pass_rate`, so a *scorer's* sole job is to turn one
evaluation of a candidate into ``{task_id: TaskEval}``. That makes the whole
benchmark surface collapse to a single value — :class:`EvalBackend` — bundling
the four bench-specific things the orchestrator needs: how to score a task set
(``eval``), the vanilla cold-start baseline over train (``cold_start``), the
screen anchor drawn from train (``anchor``), and the trajectories that feed
diagnosis (``trajectories``). SWE-bench, AppWorld, and the no-benchmark LLM
judge are each one :class:`EvalBackend` instance; nothing above this module
imports a concrete bench.

Train vs. sealed test is first-class here (SOP's iron law, as a mechanism not a
rule): ``EvalBackend`` carries both ``train_task_ids`` (the evolvable pool —
diagnosis, screen, confirm, gate, parent selection all live here) and
``test_task_ids`` (held-out; blind-scored only, never consulted for any
decision). ``eval`` takes an explicit ``split`` so one scorer serves both: the
funnel passes ``split="train"``, the sealed runner ``split="test"``.
