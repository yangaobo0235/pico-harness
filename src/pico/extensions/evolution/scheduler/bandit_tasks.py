"""Bandit-on-tasks scheduler.

Selects an informative subset of tasks to evaluate each new harness
candidate on, rather than running the full benchmark every time.

The scheduler maintains per-task state across candidate evaluations:

- ``n_trials``  — how many candidates have run this task
- ``successes``  — how many of those passed
- ``per_candidate``  — task_id → {candidate_id → pass/fail} so we can
  compute per-task variance across candidates (= discrimination power)

For each new candidate, :meth:`choose` returns ``n`` tasks scored by
**information value × uncertainty bonus**:

- information value = task's posterior variance across already-seen
  candidates (high variance = strong discriminator)
- uncertainty bonus = ``1/sqrt(n_trials+1)`` UCB-style, so under-tried
  tasks get a fair shot in early rounds

This is a quality-diversity flavoured variant of best-arm identification
(Even-Dar et al. 2006, Audibert & Bubeck 2010). It is **not** classical
UCB — UCB would maximize expected reward; we want to maximize
**ranking information**, which is captured by between-candidate variance.

Algorithmic notes for the paper:

- Beta(1+s, 1+f) posterior per (task, candidate) cell — Laplace prior
- Successive elimination by ``mark_resolved``: once a task is "decided"
  (e.g., always-pass / always-fail across many candidates), it drops
  out of future ``choose`` rounds
- ``rng`` is seedable for reproducibility (paper requirement)

    The ``per_candidate`` map is the source of truth for variance

    ----------
    all_task_ids
        The complete pool of available task ids. ``choose`` returns a
        subset of this pool.
    prior
        Optional ``{task_id: prior_pass_rate}`` to seed initial variance
        estimates. Useful when porting between benchmarks or warm-starting
        from historical runs.
    exploration_weight
        Scales the UCB-style uncertainty bonus. Larger value → favours
        under-tried tasks more aggressively. Default 1.0 matches standard
        UCB1 constant.
    rng_seed
        Seed for the internal RNG used to break ties and inject small
        exploration noise. Set this for reproducible paper experiments.
