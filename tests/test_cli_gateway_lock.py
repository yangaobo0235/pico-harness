"""Unit tests for the gateway single-instance lock helper.

Covers acquire / already-running / read_status liveness probe / corrupt payload
/ Windows lock-less degrade. The lock is an advisory ``fcntl.flock`` keyed to
``get_data_dir()/gateway.lock``; two separate ``open()`` calls on the same file
contend even within one process, so a second acquire raises while the first
handle is held.
