"""Bug2 deep tests — pathological inputs, edge state, and concurrency.

The base file ``test_runtime_checkpoint_bug2.py`` validates the happy path and
core regressions; this file is the fail-safe hardening tier:

- D1: filesystem pathology (unicode names, symlinks, deep nesting, file<->dir
      transitions, chmod, binary).
- D2: edge state (missing/read-only workspace, corrupted/blocked shadow dir,
      pre-existing files where dirs are expected).
- D3: concurrency (interleaved sessions, repeated stash, async-parallel
      commits sharing one shadow git).
