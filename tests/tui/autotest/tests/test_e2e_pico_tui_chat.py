"""Optional E2E smoke: `pico` alt-screen chat pipeline liveness.

If this passes, the harness can drive a full Ink alt-screen TUI through
RPC + streaming + slash routing + Ctrl+C autonomy — i.e., Claude Code can
independently reproduce any TUI bug from `Bash()`.

This checkout-based UI smoke is not an installed-wheel or live-Provider
acceptance gate.

This asserts the chat PIPELINE is alive (a prompt is accepted, a turn runs
through RPC + agent-loop + streaming, and the app exits cleanly), NOT any
specific model output. Asserting the model produced a particular answer (its
own name, a fact, a colour) is non-deterministic and therefore an illegitimate
e2e assertion — the model may or may not self-name, and any factual answer can
vary run to run.

Liveness is read from the status bar's turn state (working -> ready), which is
content-agnostic and robust: the Ink alt-screen redraws the entire frame each
tick (welcome art, borders, side panel), so a naive screen-text delta reports
chrome as if it were a reply. The turn-state cycle proves the pipeline ran the
turn regardless of what — or whether — the model rendered any text.

Requires:
- `tui-use` >=0.1.20 on PATH (npm install -g tui-use)
- Built `ui-tui/dist/entry.js` (npm install + npm run build in ui-tui/)
- An accessible default model configured (else the run skips, not fails)

Ink Ctrl+C autonomy yields exit 0, NOT 130. expect_exit(0) is correct.
