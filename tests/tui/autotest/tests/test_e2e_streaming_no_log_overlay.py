"""E2E regression guard: TUI chat streaming must not leak log lines onto alt-screen.

During chat token-by-token streaming, log lines (LiteLLM verbose
DEBUG traces) print to the TUI terminal and overlay Ink rendering. Resize-window
recovers (Ink full redraw).

The mechanism observed at trunk 9fdf139: LiteLLM's "LiteLLM" / "LiteLLM Router" /
"LiteLLM Proxy" named loggers install their own ``<StreamHandler <stderr>>`` at
``import litellm`` time. ``_redirect_loguru_to_file`` installs an InterceptHandler
at the root stdlib logger via ``basicConfig(level=0, force=True)`` — root NOTSET
means ``isEnabledFor`` returns True for every child, so DEBUG records propagate.
The named-logger's own stderr StreamHandler fires per chunk regardless of root
configuration; ``litellm_core_utils/streaming_handler.py:1001`` emits one DEBUG
``model_response.choices[0].delta`` per SSE event, which bleeds straight to the
inherited terminal during alt-screen rendering.

Test strategy: race the leak-pattern regex against the streaming response. If a
log-line marker appears in the alt-screen frame within 30 s of pressing enter,
the bug is reproduced — assertion fails with the captured frame for triage.
