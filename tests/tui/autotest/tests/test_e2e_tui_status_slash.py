"""E2E: `pico` alt-screen `/status` round-trip — ACCEPTANCE.

This is the **live ACCEPTANCE gate**. It exercises the full harness
path:
1. spawn production `uv run pico` (Python parent + Node child + unix
   socket RPC + Ink alt-screen renderer)
2. wait readiness in alt-screen via Harness.wait (proves snapshot polling works
   against Ink-rendered content)
3. type a slash command into the TUI input (proves character delivery through
   PTY → Ink useInput hook)
4. press enter (proves named-key delivery)
5. wait for the locally rendered retained status panel
6. press ctrl+c twice (cancel input then exit per Pico UX)
7. expect_exit 0 (proves Ink autonomy)

Zero LLM cost; exercises everything except chat streaming — see
test_e2e_pico_tui_chat.py for the chat streaming path.
