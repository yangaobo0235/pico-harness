"""Guard: channel ``required`` markers stay aligned with adapter ``start()`` guards.

Each channel's required set below is the audited truth — the credentials whose
absence makes the adapter bail on startup (see the referenced guard). The schema
markers (``Field(json_schema_extra={"required": True})``) must match this table
exactly. When an adapter changes what it enforces, update the adapter, the schema
marker, and this table in the same change.
